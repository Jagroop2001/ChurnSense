### Next Steps

Now that you understand which factors contribute most to churn, you can:

1. Perform **Customer Segmentation** to identify different user groups with similar churn patterns
2. Analyze churn trends over time with **Cohort Analysis**
3. View **Retention Recommendations** tailored to your customer base
